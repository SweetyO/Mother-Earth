Love for mother earth

     Hello everyone! Welcome to my website. First let me tell some lines about myself.

 I am creating this website to let you know the importance of protecting Mother Earth.
Mother Earth has let human beings play on her lap for many generations which we cannot
remember. But we humans are not her only child. Every life playing on her lap are her 
children. Mother Earth has provided each and every life with the same amount of love
and care. She provided them shelter and other basic needs.

I think Mother Earth has been dreaming for the day 
when her children would care and provide her with the love she had given to them.
But that dream was broken by humans. Less care about Mother Earth and more does 
not care anything about her. We have polluted the environment and endanger the  other
life living on the lap of Mother Earth to fulfill our desires. But we should remember
that by destroying Mother Earth, we destroy ourselves.
      
      Now, Mother Earth would have thinked  why she had let human beings play on lap. 
They have not just endangered themselves but other  life playing on her lap.
       
Therefore, Mother Earth would have thinked to cure and heal herself from the
destruction caused by human beings by removing them from her lap or by making them suffer.
Many may argue but I think that Mother Earth is going to heal herself by removing humans from
her lap through Coronavirus. Due to this,the pollution has decreased to a great level.
     We should now try to repair the destruction caused to Mother Earth. We should love her and
     care for all other lives playing on her lap. This is the only way for us to be Forgiven by Mother
     Earth.
Here what is your choice?
Thank you for visiting my website.
